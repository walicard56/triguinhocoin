								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>The digital economy has been undergoing a rapid transformation, especially with the integration of
									blockchain technologies in gaming. TigrinhoCoin seeks to leverage this trend by providing a
									seamless, meme-inspired digital currency that enhances in-game experiences and offers the
									potential for future applications in decentralized casinos. Built on the Polygon blockchain, which
									offers high transaction speeds and low fees, TigrinhoCoin offers a versatile, scalable, and fun
									medium of exchange for digital entertainment ecosystems.
									</p>
								<h2>About</h2>
								<p>1. Decentralization in Gaming: Centralized systems in gaming platforms restrict players' freedom,
									with in-game assets controlled by developers. Blockchain integration empowers players to own their
									in-game currencies and assets.<p>
									2. Blockchain and Casinos: As decentralized casinos grow in popularity, there is an increasing need
									for a reliable cryptocurrency tailored for such ecosystems.<p>
									3. Memetic Value: Inspired by meme culture, TigrinhoCoin taps into the viral nature of internet
									culture while providing actual utility within gaming platforms.<p>
									4. Enhanced Engagement: Reward systems that incentivize players for participation and
									engagement, such as earning through gameplay and watching advertisements, are key to user
									growth.</p>
								<h2>Blockchain</h2>
								<p>The decision to use Polygon as the underlying blockchain infrastructure is based on its high-performance capabilities, including scalability, low transaction costs, decentralization, and smart contract compatibility. Polygon can handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS) with low latency, making it ideal for high-traffic environments like gaming. Transaction fees on Polygon are minimal compared to other blockchains, allowing for frequent in-game transactions without prohibitive costs. Polygon’s decentralized architecture ensures that TigrinhoCoin transactions remain secure, transparent, and immutable. Additionally, Polygon supports smart contracts, allowing TigrinhoCoin to be seamlessly integrated into gaming ecosystems and future casino platforms through custom protocols.</p>
								<h2>Use Cases</h2>
								<p>	1. In-Game Currency: TigrinhoCoin will serve as the primary currency for in-game transactions such
									as purchasing items, skins, upgrades, and other digital assets.</p>
									2. Earning Through Play: Players can earn TigrinhoCoin by achieving milestones, completing
									missions, or engaging in competitive activities.</p>
									3. Watching Advertisements: Players can also earn TigrinhoCoin by viewing advertisements within
									supported games, incentivizing engagement without compromising user experience.</p>
									4. Casino Integration: In future updates, TigrinhoCoin will be integrated into decentralized casino
									platforms, allowing users to participate in a wide array of games of chance using their tokens.</p>
									5. Trading and Staking: Holders of TigrinhoCoin will be able to trade or stake their tokens within
									decentralized exchanges or DeFi platforms for additional rewards.</p>
